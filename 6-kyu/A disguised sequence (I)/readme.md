### A disguised sequence (I)

Given u<sub>0</sub> = 1, u<sub>1</sub> = 2 and the relation 6u<sub>n</sub>u<sub>n+1</sub>-5u<sub>n</sub>u<sub>n+2</sub>+u<sub>n+1</sub>u<sub>n+2</sub> = 0 calculate u<sub>n</sub> for any integer n >= 0.

**Examples**

fcn(n) returns u<sub>n</sub>: fcn(17) -> 131072, fcn(21) -> 2097152

Remark: You can take two points of view to do this kata:

* the first one purely algorithmic from the definition of u<sub>n</sub>

* the second one - not at all mandatory, but as a complement - is to get a bit your head around and find which sequence is hidden behind u<sub>n</sub>.
