### What's the real floor

**Task Overview**  

Americans are odd people: in their buildings, the first floor is actually the ground floor and there is no 13th floor ('cause of superstition).

Write a function that given an American floor (passed as an integer) returns the real floor.
Moreover, your function should work for basement floors too: just return the same value as the passed one.

**Usage Examples**
```javascript
getRealFloor(1) == 0 
getRealFloor(0) == 0 // Special case to please Europeans
getRealFloor(5) == 4
getRealFloor(15) == 13
getRealFloor(-3) == -3
```
