### Removing Elements

Take an array and remove every second element out of that array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

**Example:**
```javascript
myArr = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...];
```

None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
