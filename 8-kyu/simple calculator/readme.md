### simple calculator

You are required to create a simple calculator that returns the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of two numbers.

Your function will accept three arguments:
The first and second argument will be numbers.
The third argument will represent a sign indicating the operation to perform on these two numbers.

**Example:**  
```javascript
calculator(1,2,"+"); //=> result will be 3
```
if the variables are not numbers or the sign does not belong to the list above a message "unknown value" must be returned.

**Example:**  
```javascript
calculator(1,2,"&"); //=> result will be "unknown value"
calculator(1,"k","*"); //=> result will be "unknown value"
```
Good luck!
