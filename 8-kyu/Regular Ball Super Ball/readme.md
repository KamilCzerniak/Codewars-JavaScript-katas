### Regular Ball Super Ball

Create a class Ball.

Ball objects should accept one argument for "ball type" when instantiated.

If no arguments are given, ball objects should instantiate with a "ball type" of "regular."
```javascript
ball1 = new Ball();
ball2 = new Ball("super");

ball1.ballType     //=> "regular"
ball2.ballType     //=> "super
```
